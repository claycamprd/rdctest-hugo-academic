Currently, I am consultant and educator on varied subjects in research administration. In 2020 I retired as the Chief Grants Management Officer of the National Institute of Mental Health, where I was responsible for the oversight of fiscal and administrative activities of the Institute's \$1.6 billion grant and cooperative agreement portfolio. Prior to coming to the NIH in 2001, I spent 19 years as a central and departmental research administrator at the University of Kansas, the University of Iowa, and the University of Pittsburgh. I have received numerous awards and am recognized as an accomplished educator on topics across the research administration spectrum from both the sponsor and recipient perspectives.
